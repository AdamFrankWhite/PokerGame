i) First tried doing UI btn conditionals on on actual button components - big issues with rerendering and complicatied conditionals
ii) added useEffect to check which buttons to show following each time the play updated via prevAction state
iii) moved logic to separate function

// #2

When folding continuously, sometimes updateGameplay fires, messing up UI, sometimes doesn't

i) Found problem in useEffect for computer initiatehand as sb, in BettingUI
ii) it is the async nature - useEffect hook not waiting for array dependency to finish
TRY to solve issue without using useEffect?

// #3

After moving updateGameState functionality, bug of changing gameState too many times, using changing player to check
Fix: reset player turn to "" after gameState reducer changes

// #4

When beginning next gameState, issue of computer having two gos in a row, eg. check, then going first next gameState. Solved by automatically setting playerTurn to "" at end of each stage, before changing back to "computer" at start of next stage
